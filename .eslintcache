But the major\n              drawback of CVCS is its single point of failure, i.e., failure of\n              the central server. Unfortunately, if the central server goes down\n              for an hour, then during that hour, no one can collaborate at all.\n              And even in a worst case, if the disk of the central server gets\n              corrupted and proper backup has not been taken, then you will lose\n              the entire history of the project. Here, distributed version\n              control system (DVCS) comes into picture.DVCS clients not only\n              check out the latest snapshot of the directory but they also fully\n              mirror the repository. If the server goes down, then the\n              repository from any client can be copied back to the server to\n              restore it. Every checkout is a full backup of the repository. Git\n              does not rely on the central server and that is why you can\n              perform many operations when you are offline. You can commit\n              changes, create branches, view logs, and perform other operations\n              when you are offline. You require network connection only to\n              publish your changes and take the latest changes.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"slide\">\n          <div className=\"carousel_img\">\n            <img src={JEERA} alt=\"\" />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"carousel_info\">\n            <p>\n              <h3>Jira</h3>\n              JIRA is a tool developed by Australian Company Atlassian.

The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.\n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"slide slide2\">\n                    <div className=\"carousel_img\">\n                        <img src={ADVANCE} alt=\"\"/>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"carousel_info\">\n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>    \n                <div className=\"slide slide3\">\n                    <div className=\"carousel_img\">\n\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"carousel_info\">\n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>    \n                <div className=\"slide slide4\">\n                    <div className=\"carousel_img\">\n\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"carousel_info\">\n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>    \n                <div className=\"slide slide5\">\n                    <div className=\"carousel_img\">\n\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"carousel_info\">\n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>    \n                <div className=\"slide slide6\">\n                    <div className=\"carousel_img\">\n\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"carousel_info\">\n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>    \n                <div className=\"slide slide7\">\n                    <div className=\"carousel_img\">\n\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"carousel_info\">\n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>    \n                <div className=\"slide slide8\">\n                    <div className=\"carousel_img\">\n\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"carousel_info\">\n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>    \n                <div className=\"slide slide9\">\n                    <div className=\"carousel_img\">\n\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"carousel_info\">\n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>    \n                <div className=\"slide slide10\">\n                    <div className=\"carousel_img\">\n\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"carousel_info\">\n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>    \n                <div className=\"slide slide11\">\n                    <div className=\"carousel_img\">\n\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"carousel_info\">\n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>    \n                <div className=\"slide slide12\">\n                    <div className=\"carousel_img\">\n\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"carousel_info\">\n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>    \n                <div className=\"slide slide13\">\n                    <div className=\"carousel_img\">\n\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"carousel_info\">\n                        \n                    </div>\n                </div>    \n            </div>             */\n}\n","/home/nikhil/Desktop/AfterGraduation1/AfterGraduation/src/Components/Job/Job.js",[],"/home/nikhil/Desktop/AfterGraduation1/AfterGraduation/src/axios.js",[],{"ruleId":"50","replacedBy":"51"},{"ruleId":"52","replacedBy":"53"},{"ruleId":"54","severity":1,"message":"55","line":3,"column":16,"nodeType":"56","messageId":"57","endLine":3,"endColumn":26},{"ruleId":"58","severity":1,"message":"59","line":20,"column":11,"nodeType":"60","endLine":20,"endColumn":46},{"ruleId":"61","severity":1,"message":"62","line":21,"column":30,"nodeType":"63","messageId":"64","endLine":21,"endColumn":32},{"ruleId":"65","severity":1,"message":"66","line":299,"column":1,"nodeType":"67","messageId":"68","endLine":408,"endColumn":2},"no-native-reassign",["69"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["70"],"no-unused-vars","'useHistory' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","jsx-a11y/alt-text","img elements must have an alt prop, either with meaningful text, or an empty string for decorative images.","JSXOpeningElement","eqeqeq","Expected '===' and instead saw '=='.","BinaryExpression","unexpected","no-lone-blocks","Block is redundant.","BlockStatement","redundantBlock","no-global-assign","no-unsafe-negation"]
